# Briz

A small, experimental helper for server-rendered, hypermedia-driven applications.

## Why this exists

This library is built for **CRUD-heavy, server-rendered monolith apps**  
(e.g. Django, Rails, Laravel, AdonisJS, native GO with html/template) that:

- Render HTML on the server
- Want small, progressive interactivity
- Do **not** want a full SPA framework
- Prefer simplicity over abstraction

If you are looking for a full frontend framework, this project is **not** for you.

---

## Philosophy

- **Server owns the state**
- **HTML is the primary response format**
- **JavaScript is a helper, not the main actor**
- **Minimal API surface**
- **No build step**
- **Graceful fallback first**

This project borrows ideas from the broader *hypermedia-driven UI* ecosystem,  
but it is **not a replacement for htmx**, nor does it aim to compete with it.

---

## What this library does

- Declarative HTML attributes (`z-get`, `z-post`)
- Event delegation (no per-element listeners)
- Fetches **HTML fragments**, not JSON
- Optional global fetch defaults (headers, options)

That’s it.

---

## What this library does NOT do

- ❌ No virtual DOM
- ❌ No reactivity system
- ❌ No client-side routing
- ❌ No state management
- ❌ No complex swap strategies
- ❌ No attempt to cover every use case

If you need those, please use other tools.

---

## Graceful fallback

This library is designed so that:

- Links are still valid `<a href>`
- Forms still have `action` and `method`
- Without JavaScript, the app still works

Developers are expected to **write proper HTML first**,  
then enhance it with `z-*` attributes.

---

## Security note (XSS)

This library uses `innerHTML` to swap server-rendered HTML.

The assumption is:
- HTML is generated by a trusted backend
- The backend already escapes user input
- The developer controls both frontend and backend

If you are rendering untrusted HTML, **do not use this library**.

---

## Intended audience

This project is best suited for:

- Solo developers
- Small teams
- Internal tools
- Admin panels
- CRUD-heavy business apps

It is **not designed for large open-ended frontend platforms**.

---

## Stability & contributions

- API may change
- Breaking changes are allowed (for now)
- Contributions are welcome, but:
  - Please discuss ideas first
  - Keep scope small
  - Avoid feature creep

PRs that significantly increase complexity may be rejected.

## Final note

This project exists because the author needed it.

If it fits your workflow, feel free to use it.  
If not, that’s perfectly fine too.
